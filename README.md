# HighTide's More Subnautica
**HighTide's More Subnautica** is a mod for Subnautica that adds a bunch of random new things to the game that will give the survival experience a fresh feel. As of right now, this mod is very fresh and extremely early in the development process meaning that there will be very little in it. This also means that from its first versions to its later versions, there will be noticable differences in it.

## Mod Roadmap
### To-do
- Make new items (for sure)
- Make new regions (maybe)
- Make new structures (most likely)
- Make new creatures (maybe)
- Make new recipes (for sure)
- Make new voice lines (most likely)
- Make new objects (most likely)
- Make new UI elements (most likely)
- Change existing crafting recipes (maybe)
### Done
- Nothing has been done at the moment
